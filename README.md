# Dynamic-Matchmaking-Machine
Implemented the research paper titled "Dynamic Matchmaking Machine" and improved the model to get a better prediction result on MNIST dataset.

The model mimics the Complemenary Learning System of the brain i.e. the Long Term Memory System and the Short Term Memory System. The Long Term Memory System required more time to learn the data but it generalises better and it has fixed number of neurons. Whereas the Short Term Memory System learn the new information in much lesser time and as it finds new information, it keeps adding neurons to the network. 

After implementing the Dynamic Matchmaking Machine, the modified model combined the power of generalisation and the ability of Short Term Learning System to retain new information to predict better output using MNIST dataset.
